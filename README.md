Role Name
=========

***UNDER ACTIVE DEV***

This role will install the software for my personal desktop computers. It is not intended or architected to be published on Ansible Galaxy since it is a very "one off" type of configuration.

Requirements
------------

This role currently does not have any pre-requisites that are not covered by Ansible itself, or the role itself. If additional modules are added later, this section will be updated.
